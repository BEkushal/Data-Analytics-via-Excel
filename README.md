## 📝 Introduction

This Excel salary dashboard was created as part of my learning journey in data analysis. It helps users especially job seekers explore salary trends across job titles, countries, and job types to make informed career decisions.

The dataset includes job roles, salaries, locations, and required skills structured and visualized in a dynamic dashboard.

This project was built by following an excellent Excel course on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJ15nGFgVg&list=PLiSt4_1tGhCl0X8AqTebvIIHxQ_hgl5j8) I completed the entire course, recreating and understanding each component from the ground up. The dashboard represents my first complete Excel project, showcasing skills in understanding worksheet features, navigation, formula logic, charting, and interactivity.
